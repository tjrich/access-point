Access Point (Windows)
*** THIS ONLY WORKS FOR WINDOWS 7 AND HIGHER ***

This program allows you to create a hosted network,
as well as to start and stop it.
The 'Network Sharing' button only opens the 'Network Connections' window,
but internet connection sharing must be done manually.

*The Tkinter library was used to create the GUI.
